# SyntheticDataGenerator
# Synthetic Data Generator

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of our **6th semester group project** at Charusat University. Our goal was to create a **Synthetic Data Generator** that allows users to generate realistic synthetic data for **machine learning training, analytics, and privacy protection**.

### 🎯 **How We Came Up with This Idea**
- We brainstormed multiple ideas before settling on this project. In our **previous semester**, we built an **Image Resolution Enhancer using SRGAN (Super-Resolution GAN)**, so we wanted to continue working with **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**.
- During my **internship as a Data Analyst**, I worked on a **Point of Sale (POS) system** where I had to collect data about its **customer market and competitors**.
- While searching for **synthetic data generation tools**, I realized that most of them were **paid** and not very **accurate**. Some only used basic **Python libraries** to generate random numbers, which lacked real-world relevance.
- To **solve this issue**, we built our **own Synthetic Data Generator**, leveraging **CTGAN** (Conditional Tabular GAN) for high-quality synthetic data generation.

## 🚀 **Key Features**
✅ Upload & process CSV files  
✅ Specify categorical columns  
✅ Train on user-provided sample data using **CTGAN**  
✅ Generate the requested number of synthetic rows  
✅ If you don’t have a sample CSV, click on **"I Don't Have Sample Data"** to manually add sample data  
✅ Clean and user-friendly UI designed in **Canva** with well-matched fonts and colors  

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**
